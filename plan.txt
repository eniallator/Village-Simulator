Village Layout:

- Buildings connected to roads
- pathways going off of roads that connect the village to resources
- In the center there will be a village center building which will be the main user interaction building that will
  be the way for the player to progress through stages in the world
- Default buildings will be a blacksmith (where villagers can receive tools from), a resource collection building

Villagers:

- Have a path finding algorithm for them to be able to navigate through buildings and also find roads/pathways
- Path finding algorithm prioritises pathways then roads and then the resource drop off building when going back
- Each villager can be designated a task from the player to do a certain task until told otherwise
- Can collect resources and bring them back to the village
- Inventory size will be upgradable but on a global level instead of allocating extra inventory space to villagers
-

Resources:

- Gold can be mined with the use of a pickaxe
- Wood can be harvested with the use of a hatchet
- Grain can be planted and harvested with the use of a sickle/hoe
-

World Layout:

- Resources randomly scattered throughout the world
-

User Interface:

- Action bar in the middle at the bottom of the window
- Mini-map where you can see resources/buildings/roads/pathways as different colours on it
- Highlight villagers with a certain action selected
- Designate tasks to villagers for resources by clicking on the wanted resource in the world
- Zoom in and out of the world by scrolling with the mouse
-


Grid or coordinate system? - Pathfinding?
- Make a network of nodes that will be each of the 4 corners of any obstacle
- Then when calculating a path, first figure out what nodes have line of sight of eachother and make an edge also take into account hitbox size
- After the network has been created, cache the network and reuse for any equal hitboxes and only update the network when any obstacles update

To figure out what buildings there are on the map, use a map.register(BUILDING_OBJECT) or similar method
